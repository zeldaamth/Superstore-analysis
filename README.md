# Superstore Analysis
## ðŸ“Œ Project Background

With growing demand and cut-throat competition, a Superstore giant is seeking data-driven clarity on what to scale and what to avoid. This project analyzes 2014-2017 performance to identify which products, regions, categories, and customer segments drive profitable growthâ€”and which erode margins. The goal is to translate raw transactions into clear commercial actions.
Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- Sales Trends Analysis: Evaluation of historical sales patterns, both state and by region, focusing on Sales and Profit Margin.
- Product Level Performance: An analysis of Superstore's various product, product categories and sub-categories, understanding their impact on sales and profit.
- Regional Comparisons: An evaluation of sales, orders, and profit by region.

## ðŸ“ˆ Executive Summary

The analysis of Superstoreâ€™s performance highlights clear seasonal sales patterns, with strong peaks during year-end holidays and consistent slowdowns at the beginning of the year. Consumers represent the largest customer segment, while office-related products, especially binders and supplies, dominate order volume. Technology products, particularly copiers, contribute significantly to profitability, underscoring their high-margin potential. Discounting above 20% consistently erodes profit, indicating the need for a structured pricing strategy. Regionally, the East leads overall sales and orders, followed by the West, emphasizing opportunities to strengthen performance in underperforming regions.

Below is the overview page from the PowerBI dashboard and more examples are included throughout the report.

### 1. Sales Trend
<img width="800" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9561a973-bedc-4bd3-9adb-0bf6d5582c84" />

- The company's sales peaked in November 2017 with 459 orders totaling $118,447.83. Similar upward trends were observed in November 2014, November 2015, and December 2016, suggesting strong seasonal demand during the year-end holiday period..
  
- Starting from February 2014, total sales dropped to 46 orders amounting to $4,519.89, representing a 68% decline from $14,236.90 in the previous month. This recurring downward trend was also evident in February 2015, January 2016, and January 2017.

-  Seasonal patterns significantly influence sales performance, with strong peaks during year-end months. This indicates that demand forecasting and targeted promotional campaigns should be concentrated around holiday seasons to maximize revenue. Meanwhile, early-year periods consistently show weaker sales performance, suggesting a post-holiday slowdown. Strategic interventions such as early-year discounts, bundled offers, or targeted marketing campaigns could help mitigate these seasonal declines.
  
### 2. Customer Segments

- Based on total order volume, Office Supplies ranks as the leading product category, followed by Furniture and Technology. Office Supplies leads significantly with a total of 6,026 orders, underscoring its consistent demand across customers.
- Within product subcategories, the top five in terms of total orders are Binders, Paper, Furnishings, Phones, and Storage. Binders dominate at the subcategory level, recording 1,523 orders, reflecting their essential role in everyday business operations.
- These findings highlight the strong dependency on office-related products, suggesting that optimizing inventory and promotional strategies in these categories could yield significant improvements in customer satisfaction and sales performance.

### 4. Discount Impact on Profitablity
<img width="800" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16b21b3f-ab37-4d7f-9375-3b018535cde7" />

- The discount program analysis at Superstore shows that discounts above 20% consistently result in negative profitability, highlighting the risks of excessive price reductions. In contrast, a 20% discount emerges as the optimal threshold, balancing sales growth with margin protection. This suggests that adopting a structured discount strategy capping discounts at 20% while tailoring offers to products, customer segments, or seasonal demand can help maximize revenue and sustain long-term profitability.

- Based on total orders and sales, the East region recorded the highest performance, followed by the West region.

## Recommendations:
Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided:
- Cap discounts at 20%, since higher reductions consistently resulted in negative profits. Simulate scenarios; a 20% discount maintains profitability, while a 30%+ discount flips profit negative. Therefore, recommend **applying tiered discounts (10â€“20%) based on customer loyalty** or volume rather than blanket promotions.
- Since sales peaked in November 2017 ($118,447.83, 459 orders) and showed similar spikes in previous years, **allocate at least 25â€“30% of annual marketing spend toward Q4 campaigns**. **Launch holiday promotions 1â€“2 months earlier** (Octoberâ€“November) to capture peak demand and maximize revenue.
- Address October 2016 regional declines (East âˆ’54.3%, South âˆ’36.1%, Central âˆ’35.4%, West âˆ’32.7%) with region-specific early Q4 campaigns. Since the East region leads sales ($107,412.37 in September), **allocate ~40% of regional marketing budget** there, **while investing 25% in West, 20% in Central, 15% in South to balance performance**.
- Office Supplies (6,026 orders) and Binders (1,523 orders) drive the highest volume; ensure +15â€“20% inventory buffer during peak months to avoid stockouts. **Promote high-margin technology products** (e.g., copiers with $25,199.93 profit) by **bundling them with office supplies to cross-sell and boost profit per transaction**.

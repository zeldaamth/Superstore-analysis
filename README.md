# Superstore Analysis
## ðŸ“Œ Project Background

With growing demand and cut-throat competition, a Superstore giant is seeking data-driven clarity on what to scale and what to avoid. This project analyzes 2014-2017 performance to identify which products, regions, categories, and customer segments drive profitable growthâ€”and which erode margins. The goal is to translate raw transactions into clear commercial actions.
Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- Sales Trends Analysis: Evaluation of historical sales patterns, both state and by region, focusing on Sales and Profit Margin.
- Product Level Performance: An analysis of Superstore's various product, product categories and sub-categories, understanding their impact on sales and profit.
- Regional Comparisons: An evaluation of sales, orders, and profit by region.

## ðŸ“ˆ Executive Summary

The analysis of Superstoreâ€™s 2014 - 2017 performance reveals that overall sales were largely driven by Technology and Furniture, with Phones and Chairs as the top-performing sub-categories. California led as the state with the highest sales, followed by New York, Texas, and Washington. While sales show positive growth, profit margins are inconsistent due to varying discount levels and product profitability. Discounts above 20% significantly reduce profit margins, highlighting the need for a more strategic discount policy. Furthermore, the Consumer segment contributed the largest sales volume, while the Corporate segment provided steadier profitability.

Below is the overview page from the PowerBI dashboard and more examples are included throughout the report.

### 1. Sales Trend
<img width="800" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9561a973-bedc-4bd3-9adb-0bf6d5582c84" />

- The company's sales peaked in November 2017 with 459 orders totaling $118,447.83. Similar upward trends were observed in November 2014, November 2015, and December 2016, suggesting strong seasonal demand during the year-end holiday period..
  
- Starting from February 2014, total sales dropped to 46 orders amounting to $4,519.89, representing a 68% decline from $14,236.90 in the previous month. This recurring downward trend was also evident in February 2015, January 2016, and January 2017.

-  Seasonal patterns significantly influence sales performance, with strong peaks during year-end months. This indicates that demand forecasting and targeted promotional campaigns should be concentrated around holiday seasons to maximize revenue. Meanwhile, early-year periods consistently show weaker sales performance, suggesting a post-holiday slowdown. Strategic interventions such as early-year discounts, bundled offers, or targeted marketing campaigns could help mitigate these seasonal declines.

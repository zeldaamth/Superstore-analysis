# Superstore Analysis
## ðŸ“Œ Project Background

With growing demand and cut-throat competition, a Superstore giant is seeking data-driven clarity on what to scale and what to avoid. This project analyzes 2014-2017 performance to identify which products, regions, categories, and customer segments drive profitable growthâ€”and which erode margins. The goal is to translate raw transactions into clear commercial actions.
Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- Sales Trends Analysis: Evaluation of historical sales patterns, both state and by region, focusing on Revenue, Order Volume, and Average Order Value (AOV).
- Product Level Performance: An analysis of Superstore's various product, product categories and sub-categories, understanding their impact on sales and profit.
- Regional Comparisons: An evaluation of sales, orders, and profit by region.

## ðŸ“ˆ Executive Summary

The analysis of Superstoreâ€™s 2014 - 2017 performance reveals that overall sales were largely driven by Technology and Furniture, with Phones and Chairs as the top-performing sub-categories. California led as the state with the highest sales, followed by New York, Texas, and Washington. While sales show positive growth, profit margins are inconsistent due to varying discount levels and product profitability. Discounts above 20% significantly reduce profit margins, highlighting the need for a more strategic discount policy. Furthermore, the Consumer segment contributed the largest sales volume, while the Corporate segment provided steadier profitability.

Below is the overview page from the PowerBI dashboard and more examples are included throughout the report.
